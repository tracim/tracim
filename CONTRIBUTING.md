## How to

### Opening an issue

### Create a pull request

Once you have finished your development and you want to merge it on `develop`, please create a pull request. The pull request must have a title explicit, for example: `feat(frontend): <your feature>`. Once the pull request is created, follow the template.

## Code Formatting and Others Checks

### Pre-commit

To enforce most required guidelines, please use the precommit mechanism.
This will perform some automatic checks before committing.
This is required to contribute to Tracim.

To use it, you need the `pre-commit` Python package (installed with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` on the backend)
you can then install hooks with:

    pre-commit install

Then, you will be able to notice the automatic checks when running `git commit`.

Note: the pre-commit hook requires Python 3.7 or later to work.
