## PostgreSQL ##

If you want use `PostgreSQL` as database engine:

    sudo apt install postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql postgresql-client

### Minimalist introduction to PostgreSQL ###

If you already use/know `PostgreSQL`, you can directly go to *Test the database access*.

#### Allowing local connections on PostgreSQL ####

Debian `PostgreSQL` stores connections authorization in `/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf`. Edit this file and check that connection from `127.0.0.1` are allowed using user/password. You should find the following line in the file:

    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

If you changed the file, reload `PostgreSQL`:

    service postgresql reload

#### Creating a user and associated database ####

You need a database and associated user/password. Tracim comes with `pgtool`, tool that will make this step easy:

    ./bin/pgtool help

Run the following self explanatory commands:

    sudo su postgres
    ./bin/pgtool create_user tracimuser tracimpassword
    ./bin/pgtool create_database tracimdb
    ./bin/pgtool grant_all_privileges tracimdb tracimuser
    exit

#### Test the database access ####

So, now you have a database and an associated user/password. A good habit is to test things before to use them, that's why we want to test the database access. This is easily done with Tracim `pgtool`:

    ./bin/pgtool test_connection tracimdb tracimuser tracimpassword 127.0.0.1

The result is similar to the following :

    PG # CONNECT TO DATABASE
    ------------------------
    server:     127.0.0.1
    database:   tracimdb
    username:   bibi

                  now
    -------------------------------
     2014-11-10 09:40:23.306199+01
    (1 row)

In case of failure, you would get something like this:

    PG # CONNECT TO DATABASE
    ------------------------
    server:     127.0.0.1
    database:   tracimdb
    username:   bibi

    psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "bibi"
    FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "bibi"
    ERRROR

In this case, delete the user and database you previously created, using `pgtool`, and do it again. Do not forget to run the `grant_all_rights` command!

## MySQL ##

Or if you want to use `MySQL` as database engine

    sudo apt install mysql-server

### Minimalist introduction to MySQL ###

#### Driver ####

Tracim uses the `PyMySQL` driver between the `SQLAlchemy` ORM and the `MySQL` RDBMS. The only requirement is a pip installable package:

    pip install PyMySQL

#### Create database ####

Connect to `MySQL` with root user (password has been set at "Installation" -> "Dependencies" chapter, when installing package)

    mysql -u root -p

Create a database with following command:

    CREATE DATABASE tracimdb;

Create a user with following command:

    CREATE USER 'tracimuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tracimpassword';

And allow him to manipulate created database with following command:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tracimdb . * TO 'tracimuser'@'localhost';

Then flush privileges:

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

You can now quit `MySQL` prompt:

    \q

## SQLAlchemy settings ##

In the file `tracim/development.ini`, search the lines corresponding to the `SQLAlchemy` database url parameter `sqlalchemy.url`. `SQLite` is the default active database and others should be commented.

If you're willing to choose `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL`, comment the `sqlalchemy.url` line corresponding to `SQLite` and uncomment the one of your choice.

For example with `PostgreSQL`, this should gives you:

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://tracimuser:tracimpassword@127.0.0.1:5432/tracimdb?client_encoding=utf8
    # sqlalchemy.url = mysql+pymysql://tracimuser:tracimpassword@127.0.0.1/tracimdb
    # sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///tracimdb.sqlite

Proceed as above for the file `tracim/tests.ini`, except that you need to reproduce these steps three times for each of the following entries:

- [app:main]
- [app:ldap]
- [app:radicale]

Again with `PostgreSQL`, this should gives you:

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://tracimuser:tracimpassword@127.0.0.1:5432/tracimdb_test?client_encoding=utf8
    # sqlalchemy.url = mysql+pymysql://tracimuser:tracimpassword@127.0.0.1/tracimdb_test
    # sqlalchemy.url = sqlite:///tracimdb_test.sqlite

*Note: Do not copy the lines from the file `tracim/development.ini` to the file `tracim/tests.ini`, the database names aren't the same.*
