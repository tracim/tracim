## Compatibility

OS compatibility (tested with Python >= 3.6.14):

- Debian:
  - Buster (10)
  - Bullseye (11)
- Ubuntu:
  - Bionic (18.04)
  - Focal (20.04)

Older versions of Debian (8, 9) and Ubuntu (16.04) should work as long as a python version >= 3.6 is used.

## Backend

To install the backend, you have two options:

### Option 1: Automated script

Ensure your shell has an UTF-8 locale.

    echo $LANG

should return a string like `en_EN.UTF-8`.

Run the script:

    ./setup_default_backend.sh

This script runs the backend with a simple default configuration: `development.ini` configuration file. It uses the default config file, sqlite database, etc.

This script uses sudo, make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, you can use it under root:

    ./setup_default_backend.sh root

#### Script explaination

For each missing configuration file, this script will generate them from the default configuration.
If the default SQLite database is missing, the script will generate it.
This script may also be used for updates. To update a script generated by the [Tracim](https://www.algoo.fr/fr/tracim) installation, update the source code with git pull and rerun the same script to update the database model, the system and Python dependencies.

#### Script options

In some case, you may want to not install some dependencies.<br>
For example, if you are using arm64:

    IGNORE_FULL_PREVIEW_GENERATOR=1 ./setup_default_backend.sh


Here is the list of every option:
- `IGNORE_FULL_PREVIEW_GENERATOR`: ignore the installation of the full preview generator.
- `IGNORE_APT_INSTALL`: ignore the installation of the dependencies with apt-get.
- `DONT_GENERATE_PYENV`: don't generate the `.pyenv` directory.

<!-- To check -->
For more information about configuring the backend, see [Backend README](../backend/README.md).
For more information about the configuration files, see [development.ini.sample](../backend/develompent.ini.sample) and the [backend setting documentation](../backend/doc/setting.md).

### Option 2: Manually

See the [Backend README](../backend/README.md).

#### Dependencies

To install the backend, you need to install the following dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt update
xargs sudo apt install < system_packages/debian/build_backend_packages.list
xargs sudo apt install < system_packages/debian/run_backend_packages.list
```

Additionally, you can install the preview dependencies for a better preview support (LibreOffice, Inkscape, FFmpeg,...):

```shell
sudo apt install system_packages/debian/optional_preview_packages.list
```

### VirtualEnv

To use TracimCLI, you need to be in a Python virtual environment.<br>
To do so, you firstly need to create a Python virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv env

Then activate it in your terminal session:

    source env/bin/activate

Note: Every Tracim command execution must be executed under this virtual environment.

### Others

Install packaging tools:

    pip install -r requirements-build.txt

(Optional) Install strict supported version of dependencies with requirement.txt:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

(Optional) Install all preview builders to be able to generate preview for most file formats:

    pip install -r requirements-full-preview-generator.txt

Install the project in editable mode with its develop requirements:

    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    pip install -e "."

If you want to use PostgreSQL, database engine instead of the default one (SQLite bundled with 
python), you need to install the python driver for those databases that are supported by SQLAlchemy.

For PostgreSQL, those are shortcuts to install Tracim with test and specific driver.

For PostgreSQL:

    pip install -r requirements-db-postgres.txt

If you want to store files on s3, you need to install the S3 driver:

    pip install -r requirements-storage-s3.txt


## Frontend

To install the frontend dependencies, all you have to do is to run the script:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh

This script uses sudo. Make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh root

Then, you can build the frontend:

    ./build_full_frontend.sh

### Development build

You may want to build only an application and not the whole frontend.<br>
To do so, you will have to build the application by moving into the application folder.

If you want to build `frontend`:

    cd frontend
    ./build_frontend.sh

If you want to build `frontend_app_<any_app>`

    cd frontend_app_agenda
    ./build_app.sh

If you want to build `frontend_lib`:

    cd frontend_lib
    ./build_frontend_lib.sh

On top of that there is an option `-d` to build the frontend in development mode:

    ./build_full_frontend.sh -d

This allow to faster builds and better debugging.

## Run development server

To run the development server, accessible at [localhost:7999](http://localhost:7999), you have to run the script:

    ./run_dev_backend.sh
