## Compatibility
OS compatibility (tested with Python >= 3.6.14):

- Debian:
  - Buster (10)
  - Bullseye (11)
- Ubuntu:
  - Bionic (18.04)
  - Focal (20.04)

Older versions of Debian (8, 9) and Ubuntu (16.04) should work as long as a python version >= 3.6 is used.

## Backend
To install the backend, you have two options:

### Option 1: Manually

See the [Backend README](../backend/README.md).

### Option2: Automated script

Ensure your shell has an UTF-8 locale.

    echo $LANG

should return a string like `en_EN.UTF-8`.

Run the script:

    ./setup_default_backend.sh

This script runs the backend with a simple default configuration: `development.ini` configuration file. It uses the default config file, sqlite database, etc.

This script uses sudo, make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, you can use it under root:

    ./setup_default_backend.sh root

#### Script explaination

For each missing configuration file, this script will generate them from the default configuration.
If the default SQLite database is missing, the script will generate it.
This script may also be used for updates. To update a script generated by the [Tracim](https://www.algoo.fr/fr/tracim) installation, update the source code with git pull and rerun the same script to update the database model, the system and Python dependencies.

#### Script options

In some case, you may want to not install some dependencies.

For example, if you are using arm64:

    IGNORE_FULL_PREVIEW_GENERATOR=1 ./setup_default_backend.sh


Here is the list of every option:
- `IGNORE_FULL_PREVIEW_GENERATOR`: ignore the installation of the full preview generator.
- `IGNORE_APT_INSTALL`: ignore the installation of the dependencies with apt-get.
- `DONT_GENERATE_PYENV`: don't generate the `.pyenv` directory.

<!-- To check -->
For more information about configuring the backend, see [Backend README](../backend/README.md).
For more information about the configuration files, see [development.ini.sample](../backend/develompent.ini.sample) and the [backend setting documentation](../backend/doc/setting.md).


## Frontend

To install the frontend dependencies, all you have to do is to run the script:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh

This script uses sudo. Make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh root

Then, you can build the frontend:

    ./build_full_frontend.sh

### Development build

You may want to build only an application and not the whole frontend.<br>
To do so, you will have to build the application by moving into the application folder.<br>
For example:

    cd frontend_app_agenda
    ./build_app.sh

If you want to build `frontend_lib`:

    cd frontend_lib
    ./build_lib.sh

On top of that you have an option to build the frontend in development mode:

    ./build_full_frontend.sh -d

This allow to faster builds and better debugging.

## Run development server
To run the development server, accessible at [localhost:7999](http://localhost:7999), you have to run the script:

    ./run_development_server.sh
