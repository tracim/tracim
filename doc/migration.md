# Performing migrations #

##Â Introduction ##

This document is intended to developers.

Migrations on `Tracim` lays on [`gearbox migrate`](http://turbogears.readthedocs.io/en/tg2.3.7/turbogears/migrations.html), which in turn lays on [`alembic`](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/index.html) which is the migration tool dedicated to `SQLAlchemy`.

In order to use the `gearbox migrate [...]` commands, change your current directory to be `tracim/` from the root of the project, also usually named `tracim/` :

    (tg2env) user@host:~/tracim$ cd tracim/
    (tg2env) user@host:~/tracim/tracim$

## Migration howto - Advanced (for developers) ##
