## What is Tracim?

Tracim is a collaborative platform software intended for (not only technical) team collaboration. It is simple to use, offers a user-friendly interface and runs on every computer. It is very valuable for R&D teams, assocations, remote collaboration.

More information on the website: https://www.tracim.fr (in French)

## Quick start (using Docker)

Test Tracim on your computer with Docker:

```
mkdir -p ~/tracim/etc
mkdir -p ~/tracim/var
docker run -e DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite -p 8080:80 -v ~/tracim/etc:/etc/tracim -v ~/tracim/var:/var/tracim algoo/tracim
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 and log in:

- email: `admin@admin.admin`
- password: `admin@admin.admin`

For advanced docker-based usage, look at the full [Tracim Docker documentation](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/tree/develop/tools_docker),

## License

Tracim is distributed under the terms of 3 distinct licenses:

- AGPLv3 for the Agenda application (`frontend_app_agenda` folder)
- LGPL for other frontend parts (`frontend` and `frontend_xxx` folders)
- MIT License for the rest (backend stuff, functionnal tests, docker recipe, documentation, etc).

## Contribute

In order to contribute to the Tracim source code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file

## Advanced - Install Tracim from Source

OS compatibility (tested with Python >= 3.5.2):

- Debian:
  - Jessie (8)
  - Stretch (9)
  - Buster (10)
- Ubuntu:
  - Trusty (14.04) - need manual modification to install Tracim, see https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2514
  - Xenia (16.04)
  - Bionic (18.04)

### Get the source code

Get the source code from GitHub (you need git):

    git clone https://github.com/tracim/tracim.git
    cd tracim/

### Install the backend

#### Option 1: Install the backend manually

See the [Backend README](backend/README.md).

#### Option2: Install backend: Automated script for easy setup

This script runs the backend with a simple default configuration: development.ini conf file. It uses
the default config file, sqlite database, etc.

    ./setup_default_backend.sh

This script uses sudo. Make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./setup_default_backend.sh root

For each missing configuration file, this script will generate them from the default configuration.
If the default SQLite database is missing, the script will generate it.
This script may also be used for updates. To update a script
generated by the Tracim installation, update the source code with git pull and
rerun the same script to update the database model, the system and Python dependencies.

For more information about configuring the backend, see [Backend README](backend/README.md).
For more information about the configuration files, see development.ini.sample and the [backend setting documentation](backend/doc/setting.md).


### Install the frontend

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh
    ./build_full_frontend.sh

This script uses sudo. Make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh root

You can add "-d" to build_full_frontend.sh to disable obfuscation and reduce build time.

### Run Tracim for development

    # runs the needed services using docker and a tracim web app
    ./run_dev_backend.sh

This script will launch the minimal services for a functional backend: pushpin + web application.
The application will then be available on [http://localhost:7999](http://localhost:7999).

### Run Tracim for production

Tracim is composed of multiples services, some are web wsgi applications and others
are daemons (servers not web-related to do some task like sending email).

You should install pushpin, see [their installation procedure](https://pushpin.org/docs/install/) for your OS.
We recommend to use pushpin version 1.30 as this version has been extensively tested and is in use in our official docker image.

You then need to configure pushpin to proxy tracim (by default tracim web run on port 6543):

    echo "* localhost:6543" | sudo tee /etc/pushpin/routes

and after this change you need to restart your pushpin service:

    sudo systemctl restart pushpin

 Tracim WSGI apps with pastedeploy (config in development.ini):

    cd backend/
    source env/bin/activate

    # running web server
    pserve development.ini

You can run other WSGI services with pastedeploy using the `tracimcli` command:

    # running webdav server
    tracimcli webdav start

    # running caldav server (for agendas)
    tracimcli caldav start
    tracimcli caldav sync  # sync Tracim data with radicale caldav server

You can run some Tracim daemons too if you want those features:

    # set tracim_conf_file path
    export TRACIM_CONF_PATH="$(pwd)/development.ini"

    ## DAEMONS SERVICES
    # email notifier (if async email notification is enabled)
    python3 daemons/mail_notifier.py &

    # email fetcher (if email reply is enabled)
    python3 daemons/mail_fetcher.py &

You can now head to (if pushpin is correctly configured and use default port 7999)
[http://localhost:7999](http://localhost:7999) and login with the admin account:

 * user: `admin@admin.admin`
 * password: `admin@admin.admin`

:warning: If this does not work, you can try to access [http://localhost:6543](http://localhost:6543). If it works, the issue is related to the configuration of pushpin.

The full documentation about running the Tracim services with uWSGI and supervisor is available in the [Backend README](backend/README.md), sections `Running Tracim Backend Daemon`
and `Running Tracim Backend WSGI APP`.

### Upkeep

When the default "file" storage is used for session files you need to regularly remove old sessions files as they aren't removed automatically when the session expires (either of old age or when a user logs out). Other session storage (e.g. redis) do not have this behavior.
Please read the [session documentation](backend/doc/setting.md#User_sessions_in_Tracim) for more information and recommended ways to remove the unused session files.



### Running tests with Cypress

#### Installation of Cypress: Automated script for easy setup

This script installs some system dependencies of Cypress and checks whether files package.json and cypress.json exist in 'functionnal_tests' folder. If not, the script installs the necessary files.

    ./setup_functionnal_tests.sh

This script uses sudo, make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./setup_functionnal_tests.sh root

If you need to run Cypress with an external server of Tracim, modify "baseurl" in cypress.json (for more details, see: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html#Options ).


#### Run tests from the command line ##

To runs all the tests in the 'functionnal_tests/cypress/integration' folder:

    # runs the needed services using docker and a tracim web app, then runs the cypress tests
    ./run_dev_backend.sh cypress run

#### Run tests with Cypress GUI ##

You can watch the tests running directly from a (graphical) web interface:

    # runs the needed services using docker and a tracim web app, then starts cypress in GUI mode
    ./run_dev_backend.sh cypress open

### Running frontend unit tests

#### Prerequisite for unit tests

To run unit tests, you need to install frontend dependencies and build the full frontend:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh
    ./build_full_frontend.sh

This first script uses sudo, make sure it is installed and configured.
Alternatively, under root:

    ./install_frontend_dependencies.sh root

#### Run tests

To run all the unit tests:

    ./run_frontend_unit_test.sh

To run the unit tests of a specific frontend app or of frontend_lib:

    cd frontend_app_file # (or any frontend app)
    yarn run test

Note: to retrieve all frontend apps, run this command:

    ls -d frontend*
