### Breaking/Important change

- If you launched Tracim 2.7.0 or 2.7.1 on an existing database (≤ 2.6.3), an incorrect migration was performed. As a consequence, you need to downgrade your database to revision `ce074202abb2` before running Tracim 2.7.2. Please see the [documentation about downgrading](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/master/backend/doc/migration.md#downgrading-the-database).

### Breaking/Important change

### Fixed Issues

- Frontend: #2688
- Backend: #2687, #2793, #2811, #2812

- ElasticSearch: ElasticSearch: Refactor of the indexing logic. It is necessary to drop the existing index and to create it again to use ElasticSearch, use the CLI command for this (#2660)

### Known Issues

- SMTP servers using implicit SSL may cause issues with Tracim. If you not activate `email.notification.smtp.use_implicit_ssl` and you use `email.processing_mode = sync`, when Tracim tries to send email, 500 errors appear after a 5 minute timeout and its also not possible to create a new account.
In next release we will add information [here](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/master/backend/doc/setting.md#enabling-the-mail-notification-feature) to test your SMTP configuration with the Tracim configuration file (issue #2827)

### New Features

- The titles of the pages show where you are in Tracim
- It is now possible to delete users and anonymise their data with the tracimcli command
- The preview generator now supports raw and 3D files (works with Xvfb in a Docker container)
- With Apache as a proxy, it is now possible to use the browser cache policy. If you used Tracim with Docker you need to backup and delete existing Apache configuration files in `~/tracim/etc/` (default path with Tracim Docker image). On the next startup, a new file will be created with the new parameters.
- All apps are now directly enabled/disabled with one parameter and it is now easier to develop new apps.

### Fixed Issues

- Gallery: #2540, #2541, #2551, #2574, #2583

### Breaking/Important change

- `agenda`, `share_content`, `upload_permission` and `collaborative_document_edition` are now Tracim's applications (stand alone and optional), you can add/remove them from `app.enabled` list
  - `caldav.enabled` is now deprecated and agenda is enabled by default. To disable it, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps but agenda.
  - `upload_permission` and  `share_content` are enabled by default. Before 2.6.0 theses apps couldn't be disabled. To disable them, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps but `upload_permission` and/or  `share_content`.
  - `collaborative_document_edition.activated` is now deprecated and is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps, including `collaborative_document_edition`
- If you use `collaborative_document_edition` with Tracim on Docker, you need to add `-e collaborative_document_edition=1` when you start docker with `docker run` command. You can also add `collaborative_document_edition=1` in your docker-compose.yml file

### Other Changes

- 2 deprecated ldap parameters: `ldap_base_url` and `ldap_base_dn` (they where not implemented in Tracim's backend code so using them had no impact)
