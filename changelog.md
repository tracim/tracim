## 3.2.2 / 2020-11-17

### Fixed Issues

- Backend: [#3836](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3836)
 

## 3.2.1 / 2020-11-04

### New Features

- Full implementation of spaces access types: confidential, on request and open (the type of spaces created on Tracim < 3.2.1 is confidential and retain their current access behavior)
- Allow users to discover, join and leave spaces
- New plugins available:
  - Adds every new user to all open spaces and to every newly created open space. You need to activate this plugin `tracim_backend_autoinvite` (documentation available [here](backend/official_plugins/README.md))
  - Recursively adds new members of a space to its parents with the default user role of each space. You need to activate this plugin `tracim_backend_parent_access` (documentation available [here](backend/official_plugins/README.md))
  - When a user is removed from a space, this plugin recursively removes this user from the children of this space. You need to activate this plugin `tracim_backend_child_removal` (documentation available [here](backend/official_plugins/README.md))
- Frontend dependencies are grouped, making Tracim faster to load on small connections and on older devices, and more lightweight on memory consumption. For developers and sysadmins, this also makes Tracim build faster.

- Backend: [#3604](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3604)


## 3.2.0 / 2020-10-16

### New Features

- Spaces now can have sub-spaces  (a space can be child of another)
- The sidebar has been simplified and shows the new space hierarchy
- New access types for spaces (on request, open)
- Automatic tests can be done for the Tracim docker image (feature for developers)

### Fixed Issues

- Frontend: [#3596](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3596)
- Backend: [#3545](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3545),
[#3660](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3660)

## Known Issues

- It's not possible to close the sidebar by clicking around the icon (issue [#3693](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3693))
- Scroll bar on sidebar is not correctly integrated (issue [#3694](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3694))

### Breaking/Important change

- Renaming `Text document` app to `Note` (issue [#3621](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3621))
- Renaming `Shared space` to `Space` (issue [#3582](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3582))
- Webdav (issue [#3625](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3625)):
  - It is no longer possible to show two spaces with the same name in WebDAV. If two spaces at the same place have the same name, only the oldest space will be shown.
  - It is no longer possible to create/modify a space from WebDAV


## 3.1.5 / 2020-10-16

### Fixed Issues

- Backend: [#3685](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3685)


## 3.1.4 / 2020-10-07

### Fixed Issues

- TLM: [#3547](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3547)


## 3.1.3 / 2020-09-28

### Fixed Issues

- Notifications: [#3643](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3643)


## 3.1.2 / 2020-09-25

### New Features

- Start showing members in the mention suggestions right away
- Disable some notification types by default to unclutter the notification wall

### Fixed Issues

- Mention: [#3631](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3631)

## Known Issues

- Editing out a mention does not remove its associated metadata, which leads to an error when saving the document being edited in app text documents (issue [#3640](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3640)
- Clicking on a notification sometimes does not correctly open the associated content (issue [#3578](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3578))

### Other Changes

- New parameter `web.notifications.excluded` added in `development.ini.sample` to define what you want to exclude in notifications panel. There is no need to update your configuration file on existing installations if you want to keep the default set of excluded notifications.


## 3.1.1 / 2020-09-21

[#3567](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3567)


## 3.1.0 / 2020-09-14

### New Features

- A notification wall now displays the users' notifications, who can see what's happening in Tracim at a glance. It can be opened using a button in the header bar.
- It is now possible to mention users directly using their Tracim username like this: `@username`. This matches the behavior of many widespread application chats. Mentions are visible in the notification wall.

### Breaking/Important change

- These deprecated configuration parameters (in development.ini) have been removed: user.reset_password.validity, caldav.enabled, collaborative_document_edition.activated, email.notification.from. They were already ignored in previous versions. (issue [#1483](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/1483))
- The minimal PostgreSQL is now 9.6 (instead of 9.3 in previous versions of Tracim). A JSON-related bug in version 9.3 affected Tracim 3.1 and was likely fixed in version 9.4. Versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6 also brought many related fixes, including a potential buffer overflow in its JSON parser. (issue [#3523](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3523))

### Fixed Issues

- Docker: [#3418](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3418)


## 3.0.0 / 2020-08-07

### New Features

- Tracim now automatically and instantly refreshes its interface when documents and comments are created, modified or deleted. It is not necessary to reload Tracim's web page anymore to see what changed.
- It is now possible to log in using a username instead of one's email address. Usernames will be used for mentions, a feature that will be available in the next release.
- Tracim can now be configured to allow user account creation without an email address

### Other Changes

- Tracim frontend is now built with Yarn instead of NPM. See how to migrate your working copy of Tracim [here](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2916)

### Breaking/Important change

- API: api path `/v2/` no more exists in Tracim. Scripts using this old API path need to be changed and a configuration is needed to make some direct links visible in old emails work (issue [#1478](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/1478), [#3052](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3052), [#3395](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3395))
- uWSGI: default configuration change. You need to delete your config file `/{docker-volume}/etc/tracim_*.ini` (backup your files first) before starting/restarting the docker image
- Apache: default configuration change. You need to delete your config file `/{docker-volume}/etc/apache.conf` (backup your file first) before starting/restarting the docker image
- Database: databases that were created from Tracim v1 need to be updated manually, more information here: https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2785#issuecomment-660879104 (issue [#3343](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3343))
- Pushpin is now mandatory to run Tracim (pushpin is integrated by default in Tracim docker images)
- Some parameters in development.ini have been renamed, more information here https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2785#issuecomment-637544988 (issue [#3100](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3100))
- The default log of the Tracim docker image is now also visible with the `docker logs` command


## 2.7.6 / 2020-07-01

### Fixed Issues

- Backend: [#3261](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/3261)


## 2.7.5 / 2020-06-16

### New Features

### Fixed Issues

- UX: [#2993](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2993)


## 2.7.2 / 2020-05-04

### Fixed Issues

- Backend: [#2962](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2962)

### Breaking/Important change

- If you launched Tracim 2.7.0 or 2.7.1 on an existing database (≤ 2.6.3), an incorrect migration was performed. As a consequence, you need to downgrade your database to revision `ce074202abb2` before running Tracim 2.7.2. Please see the [documentation about downgrading](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/master/backend/doc/migration.md#downgrading-the-database).


## 2.7.1 / 2020-04-30

### Fixed Issues

- Backend: [#2920](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2920)


## 2.7.0 / 2020-04-24

### New Features

- Support Português language

### Improvement

- Better responsiveness by improving SQL requests (issue [#697](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/697))

### Other Changes

- The configuration file (development.ini.sample) now contains the default values used by Tracim and explanations on the settings (issue [#2204](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2204)). We advise you to be careful on existing installations when merging your configuration file with the new one.

### Breaking/Important change

- Supported databases: PostgreSQL(9.3+), MySQL(8.0.1+), MariaDB(10.3+) or SQLite(bundle with python). Older versions are no longer supported.


## 2.6.3 / 2020-04-09

### Improvement

- Better Tracim reactivity by improving Database indexing (#2787)[](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/),

### Fixed Issues

- Frontend: [#2688](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2688)

[#2811](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2811),
[#2812](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2812)

### Other Changes

- ElasticSearch: ElasticSearch: Refactor of the indexing logic. It is necessary to drop the existing index and to create it again to use ElasticSearch, use the CLI command for this (issue [#2660](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2660))

### Known Issues

- SMTP servers using implicit SSL may cause issues with Tracim. If you not activate `email.notification.smtp.use_implicit_ssl` and you use `email.processing_mode = sync`, when Tracim tries to send email, 500 errors appear after a 5 minute timeout and its also not possible to create a new account.
In next release we will add information [here](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/master/backend/doc/setting.md#enabling-the-mail-notification-feature) to test your SMTP configuration with the Tracim configuration file (issue [#2827](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/2827))

## 2.6.0 / 2020-02-06

### New Features

- Multi-upload file available in Tracim frontend (not only in public upload)
- The titles of the pages show where you are in Tracim
- It is now possible to delete users and anonymise their data with the tracimcli command
- The preview generator now supports raw and 3D files (works with Xvfb in a Docker container)
- With Apache as a proxy, it is now possible to use the browser cache policy. If you used Tracim with Docker you need to backup and delete existing Apache configuration files in `~/tracim/etc/` (default path with Tracim Docker image). On the next startup, a new file will be created with the new parameters.
- All apps are now directly enabled/disabled with one parameter and it is now easier to develop new apps.

### Breaking/Important change

- `agenda`, `share_content`, `upload_permission` and `collaborative_document_edition` are now Tracim's applications (stand alone and optional), you can add/remove them from `app.enabled` list
  - `caldav.enabled` is now deprecated and agenda is enabled by default. To disable it, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps but agenda.
  - `upload_permission` and  `share_content` are enabled by default. Before 2.6.0 theses apps couldn't be disabled. To disable them, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps but `upload_permission` and/or  `share_content`.
  - `collaborative_document_edition.activated` is now deprecated and is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment `app.enabled` parameter and put each enabled apps, including `collaborative_document_edition`
- If you use `collaborative_document_edition` with Tracim on Docker, you need to add `-e collaborative_document_edition=1` when you start docker with `docker run` command. You can also add `collaborative_document_edition=1` in your docker-compose.yml file

### Other Changes

- 2 deprecated ldap parameters: `ldap_base_url` and `ldap_base_dn` (they where not implemented in Tracim's backend code so using them had no impact)
- 2 deprecated app parameters: `caldav.enabled` and `collaborative_document_edition.activated`

## 2.3.0 / 2019-06-21

### New Features

- Search:
  - lite search similar to Tracim v1
  - smart search base on ElasticSearch (full text) ([Documentation here](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/develop/backend/doc/setting.md#search-method-using-elastic_search-tracim-23))
- Easy content move using Drag & Drop
- Lots of UX improvement

### New Features (technical)

- It's now possible to configure Tracim using environment variables ([Documentation here](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/blob/develop/backend/doc/setting.md#tracim-22-fully-supported-var))
- New licence: combination of MIT, LGPLv3 and AGPLv3
- Since 2.3 version, following services are automatically launched when Tracim start with docker:
  - Radicale (agenda)
  - WebDAV

### Migration from <= 2.2.0 to 2.3.0

- Only if you are using Docker: before starting Tracim, you need to delete files `tracim_web.ini`, `tracim_webdav.ini` and `tracim_caldav.ini` available in the default folder `~/tracim/etc` (all files are created on startup)

### Known Issues

- Debian 9 is released with Firefox ESR v60.x.x. In this version, there is a known bug with the drag & drop feature: when hovering a content over a workspace in the sidebar, only the first one gets to have its icon updated (issue [#1997](https://github.com/tracim/tracim/issues/1997))
