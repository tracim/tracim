    """Factory for a pyramid tween allowing to profile a request using pyinstrument.

    Useful to profile request in a production (docker/uwsgi) environment as pyramid
    debug_toolbar is not functional in such an environment.

    Activate it by:
      - installing pyinstrument (pip install pyinstrument)
      - setting pyramid.tweens in development.ini [app:tracim_web] section:

            pyramid.tweens = tracim_backend.lib.utils.tweens.profiler_tween_factory pyramid_tm.tm_tween_factory pyramid.tweens.excview_tween_factor

        The order and other tweens are important.
        (see https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/2.0-branch/narr/hooks.html#explicit-tween-ordering).
      - setting the profiled path with:

            profiler_tween.path = <method>:<path>

        Both <method> and <path> are written with a regex, for example:

            profiler_tween.path = (POST|GET):\/api\/workspaces\/\d+\/files  # noqa: W605

        would match both POST and GET methods for the given path.
        As the path is a regex, the slashes in the path must be escaped.
    The real request's timing (e.g. as measured by a client) is changed as the call to profiler.output_text() can be slow.
