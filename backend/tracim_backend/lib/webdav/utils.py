    Fake a FileStream that we're giving to wsgidav to receive data and create files / new revisions

    There's two scenarios :
    - when a new file is created, wsgidav will call the method createEmptyResource and except to get a _DAVResource
    which should have both 'beginWrite' and 'endWrite' method implemented
    - when a file which already exists is updated, he's going to call the 'beginWrite' function of the _DAVResource
    to get a filestream and write content in it

    In the first case scenario, the transfer takes two part : it first create the resource (createEmptyResource)
    then add its content (beginWrite, write, close..). If we went without this class, we would create two revision
    of the file upon creating a new file, which is not what we want.
