Note(RJ): This migration converts plain text descriptions to HTML
by replacing new lines to <br /> tags. This is done because previously,
the frontend did this transformation when displaying the descriptions.
Descriptions are now written using a WYSIWYG editor and we had to remove
this behavior to make this work.

Workspace descriptions need to always be sent as HTML code from now on.

    # RJ - Not doing anything for downgrade here is okay.
    #
    # The frontend will incorrectly add br tags in HTML codes, but there is
    # nothing clean we can really do. We could work around the issue by removing new
    # lines characters from HTML, but this will break description with <pre> tags.
    # We could carefully avoid removing new lines in <pre> tags, but it is also
    # possible to style elements to make them behave like <pre>, but suddently we
    # would need a CSS parser to handle the situation, which gets pretty complicated.
    #
    # It is safer not to touch descriptions here, so a future upgrade will
    # automatically fix them.
    # Administrators can always manually fix descriptions if they really need do.
