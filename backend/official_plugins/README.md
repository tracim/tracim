## Official Backend Plugins

This directory contains all official backend plugins
Those plugins are implemented using an experimental API that is planned to change: if you develop your own plugin using this API, expect it to break without notice.
You can enable them by moving the plugins or creating symlink to plugin you do need in the `plugin.folder_path` directory.
