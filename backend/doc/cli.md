### Delete user(s)

Theses commands allow to delete user from database. Unlike deletion from tracim
ui which only make data not visible anymore, this command does delete content in
database, so you need to be careful using this.

user delete provide many parameter in order to choose how you want to delete user,
we suggest to anonymize them (see `-a` or `-b` ) if deleting them could create trouble.

```
$ tracimcli user delete -h
usage: tracimcli user delete [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-d] [-w] [-a] [-r] [-b]
                             [-f] [--dry-run] -l LOGINS [LOGINS ...]
                             [--anonymize-name ANONYMIZE_NAME]

You can also anonymize user without deleting any user data user using
`tracimcli anonymize` command.

                                [--anonymize-name ANONYMIZE_NAME] -l LOGINS
